The current app is under development and not yet fully functional.

Version: 0.3 (alpha)

Development Notes for 0.3:

The app is fully functional but requires additional testing and "polishing".  Color groups select a set of 10 plants. QR codes can be scanned and checked. Once correctly scanned, the user is asked to choose between 3 possible uses of the plant - one correct, and two chosen at random that are not correct. If the correct answer is selected, the user's score is increased by "1". No points are awarded for incorrect answers.

After answering the question, the user is returned to a new plant not already selected, and the quiz repeats until the color group set is exhausted.  At that point, the user is transfered to a "Done" screen where their final score is displayed.

An alert popup is used to display whether a choice was correct or not, as well as the current total score.
