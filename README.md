The current app is under development and not yet fully functional.

Created by: Courtney Leisner

Version: 0.2 (alpha)

Development Notes for 0.2:

This development branch adds functionality for passing selected plant array index to QR code scanner and "questions" ViewControllers. It is no longer hardwired for "cotton" - it now looks for the randomly selected plant and sends to questions if correct or passes "Try again" screen if not.
